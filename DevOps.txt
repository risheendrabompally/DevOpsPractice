While logging into DB from server, give the credentials which you used when creating DB

We need to add public subnets to an ELB even if instances are in private subnets.Add atleast one public subnet to ELB to route users requests in to that AZ. And we need to add public/private subnets of an availability zones to which that instances belong to.
Add 80 port Inbound from 0.0.0.0/0 to ELB security group
Add all public subnets of same availability zone in php app
We can use custom docker images on any machine where docker is present
Docker import and export is an alternative way of storing images in docker hub. We can manually export the image from current docker machine and import it in the new docker machine.
Run docker compose commands only in the directory which contains compose files
.gitignore/.dockerigore file is used to add the files which can be ingored while building the application so that the build becomes lighter
No command for forking
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://k8sclusterlab -> run this command if you got disconnected between creating the cluster and destroying it
